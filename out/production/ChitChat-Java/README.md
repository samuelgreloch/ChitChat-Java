- Add logging to the server to log all connections and messages to some loggin sink (a file or a DB).
- Add a current user list, and the UI required to show it (either a chat command or a UI widget)
- Add a chat bot of some kind which can supply stock market news or details, sports headlines, or weather info.
- Add a way to message images
